## GitHub-API

- Hello guys, this is my Github-Api project.
- I used JavaScript (ES5-ES6-ES7), Bootstrap, HTML, some CSS, [GitHub-API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) and [JSON-Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
- Maybe this will be my last fake api project.
- I'm thinking of using real server from now on.
- Of course, I need to learn database first. :blush:
- And of course I will update my project in the coming days.
- I would be very happy if you would tell me your suggestions and my mistakes.
